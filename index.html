    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Major conflict is the updating of the drop off zone as well as the late navigation change.</li>
        <li>Key plot points are her putting lipstick on, constantly looking at the package, the  navigation updating, the strawberries flying out the container and the car drifting.</li>
        <li>Kali doesn’t have much of character arc besides staying calm in stressful situations, so it  could be her ability to constantly adapt and overcome obstacles no matter what.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Artist</h3>
    <p>
        Anxiety^2 is a young inspiring duo looking to bring back 
        the classic feeling of nostalgia and  retro feel into the
         modern era, with 80s inspired animations and drawings. 
         We are all about  having fun and creating something cool 
         and retro. First up is Matthew Benjamin Hunter who  does 
         3D modeling, animation, and mechanical drawings. He is fun, 
         quirky, hardworking, and  reliable, which shows in his work 
         as he modeled the interior and animated the car. Lastly but  
         certainly not least, the rock and the brains behind the group 
         Athena Nicole Naidoo. She does 3D  modeling, 2D/3D animation as 
         well as drawing. She is creative, determined and always wiling to try her best.

                I did the writing, titles, loglines, and artist designs. I also did some backgrounds and the  background for the main website page. I mainly stuck to our idea of Retro Cyberpunk and that  reflects in my drawings as well as my writing. Hopefully you enjoy what Athena and I created.  We really enjoyed working on this Pitch Bible and I want to do more work like this. Lastly I also  did the character backstory with Athena and the world building as well.
